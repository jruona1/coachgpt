                    <h2>John Ruona:</h2>
                    <p>I am a computer science and cybersecurity double major and a distance runner at Mount St Mary's University. I was a First-Team Member of the All-NEC rookie team my freshman year, and have scored in conference meets every single year of my collegiate career on one of the top track teams in the MAAC. I chose to create Coach GPT because I knew of a lot of runners who struggle with finding the right coach for them, and I wanted to find a solution to help others reach their highest potential.</p>
